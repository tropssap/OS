Recovery: Recovery from deadlock means whenever system gets deadlocked, OS 
should go back to the safe state and make a decision that will avoid the 
deadlock. Recovery is useful when system can go back to a safe state and 
killing a process is not the solution.
Prevention: When deadlock occurs, OS kills some processes to return into 
the safe state. Prevention of the deadlocks is useful when system shouldn't
stop by any cost and restarting the process is not a big deal.
Avoidence: System should monitor the resources that are occupied by processes 
and run only in the safe state Avoidence is particularly good when running 
processes must not be killed.
